    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM o.order_date) AS month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN o.order_date = f.first_order_date THEN o.customer_id END) AS new_customers,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN o.order_date > f.first_order_date THEN o.customer_id END) AS returning_customers
  FROM customer_orders as o
  JOIN first_orders f ON o.customer_id = f.customer_id
  GROUP BY month
  ORDER BY month


6. Payment Status Distribution

  SELECT payment_status, COUNT(*) AS payment_count
  FROM payments
  GROUP BY payment_status


7. Payment Success Rate

  SELECT ROUND((SUM(
  CASE 
  WHEN payment_status = 'completed' 
  THEN 1 
  ELSE 0 
  END) * 100.0) / COUNT(*),2) AS success_rate_percent
  FROM payments


8. Payment Failures by Method

  SELECT payment_method, COUNT(*) AS failed_payments
  FROM payments
  WHERE payment_status = 'failed'
  GROUP BY payment_method
  ORDER BY failed_payments DESC


9. Comprehensive Order and Payment Details

  SELECT
    o.order_id,
    o.customer_id,
    o.order_date,
    o.order_amount,
    o.order_status,
    p.payment_id,
    p.payment_date,
    p.payment_amount,
    p.payment_method,
    p.payment_status
  FROM customer_orders o
  LEFT JOIN payments p 
  ON o.order_id = p.order_id
  ORDER BY o.order_date DESC


10. Cohort Table Preparation

  WITH first_orders AS (
    SELECT customer_id, MIN(order_date) AS cohort_date
    FROM customer_orders
    GROUP BY customer_id),
  
  orders_with_cohort AS (
    SELECT
      o.customer_id,
      o.order_id,
      o.order_date,
      f.cohort_date,
      (EXTRACT(year from o.order_date) - EXTRACT(year from f.cohort_date)) * 12 +
      (EXTRACT(month from o.order_date) - EXTRACT(month from f.cohort_date)) AS months_since_first_purchase,
      EXTRACT(year from f.cohort_date) AS cohort_year,
      EXTRACT(month from f.cohort_date) AS cohort_month
    FROM customer_orders o
    JOIN first_orders f 
    ON o.customer_id = f.customer_id)
  
  SELECT
    cohort_year,
    cohort_month,
    months_since_first_purchase,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS retained_customers
  FROM orders_with_cohort
  GROUP BY cohort_year, cohort_month, months_since_first_purchase
  ORDER BY cohort_year, cohort_month, months_since_first_purchase
